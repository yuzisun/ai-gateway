title: Getting Started with Envoy AI Gateway
---

## Pre-requisites

Envoy AI Gateway is built on top of Envoy Gateway. To get started, we assume that your kubeconfig is set up and you have a Kubernetes cluster running.
If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, you can use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create a local cluster.

To install Envoy Gateway, you can follow the instructions in the [Envoy Gateway documentation](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/latest/tasks/quickstart/#installation):

```
# Install the Envoy Gateway Helm chart.
helm upgrade -i eg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm --version v0.0.0-latest -n envoy-gateway-system --create-namespace
# Wait for the deployment to be ready.
kubectl wait --timeout=30s -n envoy-gateway-system deployment/envoy-gateway --for=condition=Available
```

## Install Envoy AI Gateway

To install Envoy AI Gateway, the easiest way is to use the Helm chart like this:

```
# Install the AI Gateway Helm chart.
helm upgrade -i aieg oci://ghcr.io/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/ai-gateway-helm --version v0.0.0-latest -n envoy-ai-gateway-system --create-namespace
# Wait for the deployment to be created.
kubectl wait --timeout=30s -n envoy-ai-gateway-system deployment/ai-gateway-controller --for=create
# Wait for the deployment to be ready.
kubectl wait --timeout=30s -n envoy-ai-gateway-system deployment/ai-gateway-controller --for=condition=Available
```

In addition, we need to apply the AI Gateway specific configuration for the Envoy Gateway:

```
# Apply the Envoy Gateway configuration specific to AI Gateway.
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/main/manifests/envoy-gateway-config/config.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/main/manifests/envoy-gateway-config/rbac.yaml
# Restart the Envoy Gateway deployment.
kubectl rollout restart -n envoy-gateway-system deployment/envoy-gateway
# Wait for the deployment to be ready.
kubectl wait --timeout=30s -n envoy-gateway-system deployment/envoy-gateway --for=condition=Available
```

## Install basic AI Gateway setup

TODO: this is not tested.

In the `examples/basic` directory, you can find a basic setup for the AI Gateway. To install it, you can run:

TODO: this should be configured with credentials, but I am sure we don't want to require something like that
for the "getting started" doc.

```
# Install the basic AI Gateway setup.
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/main/examples/basic/basic.yaml
```
