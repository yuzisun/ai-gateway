Before you begin using Envoy AI Gateway, you'll need to ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

## Required Tools

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- `kubectl` - The Kubernetes command-line tool
- `helm` - The package manager for Kubernetes
- `curl` - For testing API endpoints (installed by default on most systems)

:::tip Verify Installation
Run these commands to verify your tools are properly installed:

Verify kubectl installation:
```shell
kubectl version --client
```

Verify helm installation:
```shell
helm version
```

Verify curl installation:
```shell
curl --version
```
:::

## Kubernetes Cluster

:::info Version Requirements
Envoy AI Gateway requires Kubernetes version 1.29 or higher. We recommend using a recent stable version of Kubernetes for the best experience.
:::

You need a running Kubernetes cluster with your kubeconfig properly configured. You have several options:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="existing" label="Existing Cluster" default>

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, ensure your kubeconfig is properly configured to access it.

Verify your cluster meets the version requirements by running:
```shell
kubectl version --output=json
```

The server version in the output should show version 1.29 or higher:
```json
{
  "serverVersion": {
    "major": "1",
    "minor": "29+",
    ...
  }
}
```

:::caution

If your cluster is running a version lower than 1.29, you'll need to upgrade it before proceeding with the installation.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker-desktop" label="Docker Desktop">

If you're using Docker Desktop, you can enable its built-in Kubernetes cluster:

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Click on the gear icon (Settings)
3. Select "Kubernetes" from the left sidebar
4. Check "Enable Kubernetes"
5. Click "Apply & Restart"

Wait for Docker Desktop to restart and for the Kubernetes cluster to be ready. You can verify the setup by running:

```shell
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
kubectl cluster-info
```

The output should show that the Kubernetes control plane is running.

:::tip

Docker Desktop's Kubernetes is a great choice for local development as it:
- Comes pre-installed with Docker Desktop
- Runs locally on your machine
- Integrates well with Docker Desktop's UI
- Requires minimal setup

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kind" label="Local Kind Cluster">

If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, you can quickly create a local one using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

First, install kind if you haven't already (on macOS with Homebrew):
```shell
brew install kind
```

Then create a cluster:
```shell
kind create cluster
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Envoy Gateway

:::warning Important

Ensure you're using a clean Envoy Gateway deployment. If you have an existing Envoy Gateway installation with custom configurations, it may conflict with AI Gateway's requirements. We recommend:
- Using a fresh Kubernetes cluster, or
- Uninstalling any existing Envoy Gateway deployments before proceeding:
  ```shell
  helm uninstall eg -n envoy-gateway-system
  kubectl delete namespace envoy-gateway-system
  ```

:::

:::info Version Requirements

Envoy AI Gateway requires Envoy Gateway version 1.3.0 or higher. For the best experience while trying out AI Gateway, we recommend using the latest version as shown in the commands below.

:::

Envoy AI Gateway is built on top of Envoy Gateway. Install it using Helm and wait for the deployment to be ready:

```shell
helm upgrade -i eg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm \
    --version v0.0.0-latest \
    --namespace envoy-gateway-system \
    --create-namespace

kubectl wait --timeout=2m -n envoy-gateway-system deployment/envoy-gateway --for=condition=Available
```
