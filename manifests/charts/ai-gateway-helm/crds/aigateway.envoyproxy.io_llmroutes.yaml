          LLMRoute combines multiple LLMBackends and attaching them to Gateway(s) resources.

          This serves as a way to define a "unified" LLM API for a Gateway which allows downstream
          clients to use a single schema API to interact with multiple LLM backends.

          The InputSchema is used to determine the structure of the requests that the Gateway will
          receive. And then the Gateway will route the traffic to the appropriate LLMBackend based
          on the output schema of the LLMBackend while doing the other necessary jobs like
          upstream authentication, rate limit, etc.

                    target single resources. For more information on how this policy attachment
                    mode works, and a sample Policy resource, refer to the policy attachment
                    documentation for Gateway API.

                    Note: This should only be used for direct policy attachment when references
                    to SectionName are actually needed. In all other cases,
                    LocalPolicyTargetReference should be used.
