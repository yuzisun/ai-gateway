          AIGatewayRoute combines multiple AIServiceBackends and attaching them to Gateway(s) resources.

          This serves as a way to define a "unified" AI API for a Gateway which allows downstream
          clients to use a single schema API to interact with multiple AI backends.

          The inputSchema field is used to determine the structure of the requests that the Gateway will
          receive. And then the Gateway will route the traffic to the appropriate AIServiceBackend based
          on the output schema of the AIServiceBackend while doing the other necessary jobs like
          upstream authentication, rate limit, etc.

          AIGatewayRoute generates a HTTPRoute resource based on the configuration basis for routing the traffic.
          The generated HTTPRoute has the owner reference set to this AIGatewayRoute.

                  An AI Gateway filter is responsible for the transformation of the request and response
                  as well as the routing behavior based on the model name extracted from the request content, etc.

                  Currently, the filter is only implemented as an external process filter, which might be
                  extended to other types of filters in the future. See https://github.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/issues/90

                                    conformance, implementations can support POSIX, PCRE or any other dialects
                                    of regular expressions. Please read the implementation's documentation to
                                    determine the supported dialect.

                    LocalPolicyTargetReferenceWithSectionName identifies an API object to apply a
                    direct policy to. This should be used as part of Policy resources that can
                    target single resources. For more information on how this policy attachment
                    mode works, and a sample Policy resource, refer to the policy attachment
                    documentation for Gateway API.

                    Note: This should only be used for direct policy attachment when references
                    to SectionName are actually needed. In all other cases,
                    LocalPolicyTargetReference should be used.

                        unspecified, this targetRef targets the entire resource. In the following
                        resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                        * Gateway: Listener name
                        * HTTPRoute: HTTPRouteRule name

                        If a SectionName is specified, but does not exist on the targeted object,
                        the Policy must fail to attach, and the policy implementation should record
                        a `ResolvedRefs` or similar Condition in the Policy's status.
