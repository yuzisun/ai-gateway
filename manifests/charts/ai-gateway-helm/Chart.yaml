description: The Helm chart for Envoy AI Gateway
type: application

# Note: in general version means the version of the chart, not the version of the application.
# version must be a semver version number like 0.0.1-rc1, 1.0.0, etc., vs appVersion can be anything.
#
# Since we release both the chart and the application together from the same repo, we don't need to differentiate
# between the two versions. version here cannot be "latest" or "main" or "master", so we use appVersion for
# the container image tags.
version: v0.0.0-latest
